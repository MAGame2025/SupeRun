**1. Challenge**

The challenge curve in SupeRun will be forgiving for beginners and challenging for players wanting to achieve a high score. There will be multiple levels ramping up in level design related difficulty (A level with more slopes, hazards like lava pools and maybe some non-random hand-crafted levels with challenging bosses) and each level will have an easy medium and hard difficulty requiring the player to successfully win the previous difficulty to progress. Each success or failure will award the player gold which will allow him to have meta progression and become stronger. In general increase in difficulty in the game will be a desired goal because it will lead to more enemies spawning more frequently which will award the player more xp quicker and will allow him to reach higher levels dealing substantially more damage.

**2. Flow**

The main goal of the game is to always be stronger than the "Challenge curve" thanks to a mix of being lucky getting the weapons and items that you want and being skillful hitting enemies in their weak points or aiming your aoe weapons properly to achieve maximum damage output. This will require the players attention knowing what weapons he will prefer to have (weapon pool of for example 10 with 4 weapon slots) and how they work. Additionally the game will have a very lootbox-ish/gambling feel with many random chests, enemy drops, random map interactables and level up upgrades. There will be an additional option for bunny-hopping/slide-jumping or sliding down slopes with increased speed letting players who want to move around the map faster have a fun way of achieving that in a more interesting and engaging way than just running.

**3. Fun**

The game will have a lot of meta progression with potential secret events, characters, weapons, NPC's or enemies with a light-hearted tone that will add intrigue and interest to the game outside the main game loop. The game is intended for casual and hardcore gamers, kids 13-18 and young adults. The easy start will allow more casual and younger players to have levels they can play and still enjoy the game loops while more serious and older players will have the higher difficulties to challenge themselves. Generally reaching broader audiences may mainly come from the meta game stuff and maybe this way possibly reach players who might want to also enjoy some story elements with their game.

**4. Feelings**

The main feelings the player should feel are: Focus and challenge trying to beat the level. Curiosity with stumbling upon secrets maybe enticing further discussion among players. The same Joy a gambler gets in the casino when he wins a bet or at the slots. Accomplishment and completionism trying to unlock weapons, characters, items and harder levels. Challenge regarding trying to achieve high scores and be presented on the leaderboard as the player who managed to reach the highest score for this week/month.

**5. Backstory**

The game will not have a backstory and will mainly be a hub for potentially funny jokes and references. Potentially some playable characters might develop a backstory if players are interested for example, a "unity capsule" character which will have semi human arms and legs but with a unity capsule for a body and a changing face. What the player will contain is probably a description for each item, weapon and character and will include useful game-related information with potentially additional information regarding the game’s/the characters' backstory.

**6. Characters**

The characters will mainly be jokes I find funny/ references to things or maybe even some original characters that I might be able to design if a backstory is ever implemented.

**7. Plot**

The game will not have a Plotline like most games and is more of an arcade game. Meta progression might have a very slight plot connecting things together but nothing deep or serious and will mainly be a vehicle for potential jokes or information about secrets.

**8. World building**

The game will have a pretty forgiving movement system including sliding, multiple jumping, momentum building bunny hopping and more options that will allow him to traverse the map quickly thus the game will have these level styles.

1. Completely randomly generated and potentially infinite in scale (looping map):

A map that will be randomly generated using a basic flat map grid creation/perlin noise or some other maze algorithm to introduce elevation/maybe some way to make a sloped map (not yet researched) and either make them very large/looping.

2. More hand-crafted approach with more potential for more secrets and special interactions:

Hand-crafted levels that will probably require the player to interact with a map. It will also be mainly random but the logic will be to close off the map in a large section (with blocking edge of map walls) and have some events that will always happen, some events that will require the player to do some things he will usually not do and some events that will randomly either happen or not.
