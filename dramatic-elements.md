**1. Challenge:**

The challenge curve in SupeRun will be forgiving for begginers and challenging for players
wanting to achieve a high score. There will be multiple levels ramping up in level design related
difficulty(A level with more slopes, hazards like lava pools and maybe some non random hand crafted
levels with challenging bosses) and each level will have a easy meduim and hard difficulty requiring
the player to succesfully win the preious difficulty to progress. Each success or faliure will award
the player gold which will allow him to have meta progression and become stronger. In general increase 
in difficult in the game will be a desired goal because it will lead to more enemies spawning more 
frequently which will award the player more xp quicker and will allow him to reach higher levels
dealing substantually more damage.

**2. Flow:**

The main goal of the game is to always be stronger then the "Challenge curve" thanks to a mix of being
lucky getting the weapons and items that you want and being skillfull hitting enemies in their weakpoints
or aiming your aoe weapons properly to achieve maximum damage output. This will require the players
attention knowing what weapons he will prefer to have (weapon pool of for example 10 with 4 weapons slots)
and how they work. Additionaly the game will have a very lootboxish/gambling feel with many random chests,
enemy drops, random map interactables and level up upgrades. There will be an additional option for 
bunny-hopping/slide-jumping or sliding down slopes with increased speed letting players who want to move 
around the map faster have a fun way of achieving that in a more interesting and engaging way then just running.

**3. Fun:**

The game will have a lot of meta progression with potential secret events, charachters, weapons, NPC's or enemies
with a light hearted tone that will add intrigue and interest to the game outside the main game loop.
The game is intended for casual and hardcore gamers, kids 13-18 and young adults. The easy start will
allows more casual and younger players to have levels they game play and still enjoy the game loops
while more serious and older player will have the higher difficulties to challenge themselves. generally
reaching broader audiences may mainly come from the meta game stuff and maybe this way possibly reach
players who might want to also enjoy some story elements with their game.

**4. Feelings:**

The main feelings the player should feel are:
Focus and challenge trying to beat the level.
Curiosity with stumbling upon secrets maybe inticing further discussion among players.
The same Joy a gambler gets in the casino when he wins a bet or at the slots.
Accpmplishment and completionism trying to unlock weapons, charachters iteams and harder levels.
Challenge regarding trying to achieve high scores and be presented on the leaderboard as the player
who managed to reach the highest score for this weak/month.

**5. Backstory:**

The game will not have a backstory and will mainly be a hub for potentially funny jokes and refrences.
potentially some playable characters might develop a backstory if players are interested
for example, a "unity capsule" charachter which will have semi human arms and legs but with a unity capsule
for a body and a changing face. What the player will contain is propably a description for each item,weapon
and character and will include usefull gamerelated information with potentially additional information
regardinig the games/the charachters backstory.

**6. Charachters:**

The charachters will mainly be jokes i find funny/ refrences to things or maybe even some original
characters that i might be able to design if a backstory is ever implemented.

**7. Plot:**

The game will not have a Plotline like most game and is more of an arcade game. Meta progression
might have a very slight plot connecting things together but nothing deep or serious and will mainly
be a vehicle for potential jokes or information about secrets.

**8. Worlds building:**
The game will have a pretty forgiving movement system including sliding, miltiple jumping, momentum building
bunny hopping and more options that will allow him to traverce the map quickly thus the game will these lelve styles.

1.Completely randomly generated and potentially intifinate in scale(looping map):
A map the will be randomly generated using a basic flat map grid creation/perlin noise or some other maze 
algorithm to introduce elevation/maybe some way to make a sloapy map(not yet researched) 
and eitehr make them very large/looping.

2.More hand crafted approach with more potential for more secrets and special interactions: 
Hand crafted levels that will propably require the player to interact with a map. it will also be mainly
random but the logic will be to close off the map in a large section(with blocking edge of map walls)
and have some events that will always happen, some events that will require the player to do some 
things he will usually not do and some events that will randomly either happen or not.
