**Level Design – SupeRun**

SupeRun is a 3D horde-survival which levles mostly consist of arena style maps.
Because of this, most levels utilize procedural map generation(not all), for replay variety and keeping development efficient.

**Level Overview**

  Tutorial Level (Handcrafted) – Introduces controls and core mechanics.

  Level 1 – Easy (Procedural) – A simple randomly generated arena with weaker enemies.

  Level 2 – Medium (Handcrafted) – A fully designed arena level with a strict 30-minute run limit and a final powerful enemy.

  Level 3 – Hard / Endless Survival (Procedural) – A highly replayable infinite survival level with scaling difficulty.



**Tutorial**

 The tutorial is a short, linear introductory level designed to teach: Basic movement (walking, jumping, sliding), Basic combat, Collecting XP and gold, Avoiding enemy attacks, Core interactions in the game

It contains a simple guided path with small safe encounters so the player can learn the controls without pressure.

**Level 1 – Easy**

  Let players experience their first real run with minimal pressure and very weak enemies and low enemy count.
  This map establishes the core gameplay loop.

  It will be Procedurally generated using a random tile grid.

  The level will have a 20 min timer when at the end a strong enemy (which the player should not be able to kill) comes and ends the run.

**Level 2 – Medium**

  A full-featured, handcrafted level that forms half of the core experience: 30 minutes of survival and build progression ending with a major enemy encounter.

  The level will include challenges and secrets that will each unlock something for the player.

  The level will have a 30 min timer when at the end a strong enemy (which killing will also be a challenge) comes and ends the run.

**Level 3 – Hard**

  An endless survival mode where players attempt to survive as long as possible against increasingly difficult waves.

  Large procedural map.

Example for enemy scaling every minute:

  +10% enemy health
  +5% movement speed
  +10% damage

  A continuous difficulty curve designed for experienced players, with constant pressure and emphasis on mastery of movement and combat.
