**Market Review and Trends(PC rougelike Horde Survival):** 

The global PC gaming market remains big, generating over [$40 billion annually](https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/gaming-industry#h2-4).
Within the PC market, recent data shows that roughly [half of 2025's top performing](https://intoindiegames.com/features/indie-and-aa-games-have-dominated-2025-so-far/) Steam games have come from independent or "AA" studios.
In April 2025, for example, indie games held the top 2 sales spots on Steam, each selling millions of copies: Schedule 1(Solo developed indie game) was #1 with 4.7 million copies sold that month and R.E.P.O(Small dev team but The number of developers for the game R.E.P.O. is not publicly specified) was #2 with 3.7 million.

Within the action genre, “horde survival” roguelike shooters (also known as “bullet heaven” or “survivor-like” games) have emerged as a popular niche since 2022 with the release of the hit game Vampire Survivors. It popularise this wave of arena survival games where players fight endless hordes and collect upgrades. Vampire Survivors – a simple 2D indie game – went viral, selling over 6 million copies on Steam (as of mid-2024) and generating an estimated [$20+ million in revenue.](https://levvvel.com/vampire-survivors-statistics/#:~:text=Vampire%20Survivors%20has%20generated%20an,million%20in%20revenue%20on%20Steam)
It peaked at ~77,000 concurrent players on Steam and earned 98% positive user reviews across 200k+ reviews. Its success sparked a flood of similar titles, creating a vibrant subgenre (The game also released for mobile and with it came a big wave of clones and knock off's with variying degrees of success). The combined player base for action-roguelike survivors remained high through 2023, indicating the genre was [not a mere fad](https://howtomarketagame.com/2023/01/09/are-vampire-survivor-likes-dead/#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20graph%2C%20you,played%20more%20than%20Vampire%20Survivors) but sustained by new content
In fact, one analysis in early 2023 noted that multiple Vampire Survivor-inspired games were “making serious money”, for example 20 Minutes Till Dawn (which added manual twin-stick shooting to the formula) grossed about $500,000 in its first week after launch.

As of 2025 new games in the genre are still finding success by iterating on the formula. Notably, [Megabonk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/#:~:text=Recent%20Reviews%3A%20Very%20Positive%20,61) – a 3D third-person “horde survival roguelike” released in September 2025 – quickly gained traction. It currently has over 28,000 user reviews (93% positive).
Megabonk is essentially a “3D Vampire Survivors” (auto-attacking, focus on absurd upgrades), and its Very Positive reception and strong sales demonstrate player demand for horde survival games remains high even three years after the genre’s rise. In sum, the market outlook for SupeRun’s genre is promising – the action-roguelike shooter space is trending upward, with indie titles regularly breaking out. The genre shows no sign of decline in player interest when it comes to a new game which can distinguish itself in this popular category.


**Target Audience:**

SupeRun will appeal to players who enjoy fast-paced, replayable action and chasing high scores. Specifically, the target audience includes fans of horde shooters and roguelikes. Gamers who loved titles like Vampire Survivors, Risk of Rain 2 or Megabonk. These players tend to be PC users aged 16-35, leaning toward those who enjoy intense action and skill-based challenges. Notably, SupeRun emphasizes skillful aiming, movement and “kiting” (dodging enemies while corralling hordes) setting it apart from auto-attack survivor games. This will attract players who found auto-shooter games fun but too passive or luck based where youre success is dictated randomly rather then by the player improving.
The game’s quick 30-minute runs and arcade pacing also make it suitable for busy people who might play in short bursts but repeatedly
The addition of a weekly leaderboard in SupeRun directly targets the competetive players who want to compare their ability to others and maybe have everyone see their achievment.
