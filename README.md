# SupeRun

SupeRun is a fast-paced 3D arcade horde shooter where you fight to survive against endless waves of enemies.  
Each run takes around 30 minutes, with randomly generated arenas and an ever-growing horde trying to overwhelm you.  
Defeat enemies to earn XP, gold, and gems — upgrade your weapons, unlock new characters, and create powerful builds to push your limits.  
Survive long enough to face the final boss, or keep going to climb the weekly leaderboard.  
SupeRun rewards skillful movement, precise aim, and smart upgrade choices for players who want intense, replayable action.
